# Additional Comments:

Took Professor Bruce Montegomery's base code for Project 2 and added onto it.

We realized towards the end (towards the end of our due date) that Bruce's code had some issues with it, that we weren't able to fix in the remaining time.

Ex. Items can be sold for negative amounts or $0.

We will change this in the next iteration of the project.
